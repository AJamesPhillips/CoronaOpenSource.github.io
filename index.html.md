# Corona Open Source

## Open source information of science and technology defeating Corona virus.

Our globalised world has optimised for two things: speed and low prices.  It is not optimised for resilience.  We might like to think of ourselves as islands but generic drugs and PPE that keep us safe are manufactured in Indian and China.  Likewise test kits and ventilator designs are produced here and elsewhere.  There are a myriad of connections.  We depend on each other.

We have some of the technologies needed to defeat corona virus right now.  Over the next few months, we'll get more.  But we need to do two things:

1. buy ourselves time to scale up those technologies
1. share our knowledge to scale up those technologies faster, globally

This is an open call to all IP (intellectual property) owners to release your IP.  Show us and help us build your technology to defeat this challenge.
